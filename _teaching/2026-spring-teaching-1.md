The course examines a broad range of cyber threats, including common attack types, threat models, and adversarial techniques, alongside defensive strategies and security mechanisms used to mitigate these risks. In parallel, the course explores key privacy issues in computing and information systems, including fair information practices, the tension between anonymity and privacy, privacy risks, tracking and surveillance technologies, and the tools, policies, and regulatory frameworks designed to protect personal data. Students will develop the ability to analyze security and privacy problems critically, evaluate technical and policy-based solutions, and reason about trade-offs between usability, security, and privacy in real-world systems. Prerequisite: M.S. or Ph.D. standing, or permission of the instructor.
